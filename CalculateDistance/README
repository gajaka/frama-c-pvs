1) Copy folder Heber into nasalib dir
   for instance : /home/moobar/formal/pvs-6.0-ix86_64-Linux-allegro/nasalib
2) Extract CalculateDistance.tar.gz in the frama-c<version>/tests folder.
   You should be able to start project using the following command: frama-c -jessie -wp-prover why3ide CalculateDistance.c


The aim of this pilot work is to show that the calculated distance is close to "ideal" distance between two crafts.
The predicate difference_nonneg deserves some explanation:
There is a lack in the definition of the sqrt function:

  % Why3 sqr
  sqr(x:real): real = (x * x)
  
  sqrt_total(x:real): real
  
  % Why3 sqrt
  sqrt(x:real): MACRO real = IF x >= 0 THEN sqrt(x) ELSE sqrt_total(x) ENDIF

The  sqrt_total is not provided by default.
In order to avoid sqrt_total(x)  the following predicate has been used :

@ predicate difference_nonneg(double* a,double* b, integer start_i, integer end_i) =
@    		\forall integer i; start_i <= i && i < end_i ==> a[i] - b[i] >=0;
